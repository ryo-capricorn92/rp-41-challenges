//1. Using your knowledge of JavaScript data types (i.e. numbers, strings, booleans,
//arrays and objects), represent our solar system as data (hint: the link is to a
//Wikipedia article â€“ you should use it). You can include as many attributes as you
//like, but the following are required:

var solarSystem = {
	age: "4.568 billion years",
	distanceFromCenter: "26000 light years",
	knownComets: 3406,
	planets: {
		mercury: {
			name: "Mercury",
			size: "0.055 Earth masses",
			distFromSun: "0.4 AU",
			knownSatellites: "No natural satellites",
		}
		venus: {
			name: "Venus",
			size: "0.815 Earth masses",
			distFromSun: "0.7 AU",

//2. Complete the below function called range that takes two integers as parameters,
//start and end, and returns an array containing all the whole numbers between them
//starting with start and up to end (you can use a for loop, while loop, each, or
//repetition with function invocation). The function definition should look like
//this:
function range(start, end) {
	var result = start;

	while (start < end) {
		result = start++;
	}
	return result;
}
